# HTML and CSS Refactor

## Description

The initial code was provided during the Module 1 challenge during the bootcamp. 
The code mostly consisted of DIV syntax and contained no comments. 
The CSS file also consisted of multiple lines doing the same styling for differing sections. 
During the fix I updated the HTML file to add new and more detailed semantics which clarify the purpose of statement. 
I also consolidated the CSS file to be more clean and added comments to clarify what each property did to style the HTML file.

## Installation

No special steps involved.

## Usage

Used to demonstrate my knowledge of refactoring.
